My January entry for One Game A Month 2013

## Story ##

>Your solar system is under attack!  
  
>Your scout ship is directing your people's only defense:  
>A giant defensive cannon that can obliterate dozens of ships at once.
  
>Try not to get hit by enemy fire while killing as many as possible.
